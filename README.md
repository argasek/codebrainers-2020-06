### Homework

This is where all homework will be put.

Task 1. Modify the code in `index.js` file in such way that
it takes care of incorrect age values user might specify.

Values considered incorrect are: 
* zero ("well, you aren't that young, are you?")
* negative numbers (`-18`, ...)
* greater than `140`
* float values (`18.37`) (you might utilize `parseFloat()` here)

Task 2.

Write a code which asks the user what year it is now and year
(s)he was born. Based on that, calculate his / her / their age.

Eg.
2018 [current year]
1934 [born]

= 84.

Use either `alert()` or `console.log()` whichever is more
convenient.
